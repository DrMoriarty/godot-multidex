This is a module for [Godot Game Engine](http://godotengine.org/) which enables multidex build for Android. 

To use it, make sure you're able to compile the Godot android template, you can find the instructions [here](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/reference/compiling_for_android.html). After that, just copy the the multidex folder to godot/modules and recompile it.
